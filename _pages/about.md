My name is Keiichi Watanabe.
I'm a senior software engineer at Google.
I earned a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Tokyo in 2018.

## Education

* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Tokyo, 2018
* B.S. in Information Science, University of Tokyo, 2016

## Work Experiences

### Software Engineer, Google Japan

*April 2018 - Present*

A senior software engineer on the ChromeOS platform team.
I'm a tech lead for a team that develops virtualization technology to run Android apps on Chromebooks.

* Developing and maintaining [crosvm], a multi-platform virtual machine monitor written in Rust for ChromeOS.
* Developing and optimizing file systems for Android VM.
* Designed and implemented a virtio-video decoder to deliver hardware-accelerated video decoding inside Android VM. Proposed [patches](https://lwn.net/Articles/803676/) to the Linux community.
